# Snake-Game

It is an arcade game Blockade that originated in 1976. This type of game became popular again in the 1990s due to appointments on mobile phones with small screens. Basically, these games can be installed on modern mobile phones. The version is also different.

In the  Snake game, when the player is aligned with a straight line (known as snake or worm), it will keep moving forward. The player can only aim at the direction of the snake (up, down, left, and right) and pick up the things that they touch (or right). Quasi) "beans") and avoid touching yourself or other obstacles. Once a greedy snake eats a piece of food, its body grows a bit. The game design is roughly gradual. Game design can be roughly divided into four sides with walls (all cannot be traversed), a certain part of the wall can be crossed, and four walls can be crossed
